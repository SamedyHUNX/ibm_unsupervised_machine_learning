## Key Learnings

### 1. Clustering Techniques
- **K-means Clustering**: Implemented partitioning-based clustering with centroid optimization
- **DBSCAN**: Explored density-based clustering for identifying clusters of arbitrary shapes and handling outliers

### 2. Dimensionality Challenges
- **Curse of Dimensionality**: Analyzed how high-dimensional spaces affect distance metrics and algorithm performance
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Implemented techniques to reduce feature space while preserving information
- **Kernel-Based Methods**: Applied kernel tricks to handle non-linear relationships in dimensionality reduction

### 3. Matrix Factorization
- **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization**: Explored techniques for decomposing data into non-negative components for interpretable feature extraction

### 4. Applied Case Study
- **Heart Disease Clustering**: Applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify patterns in heart disease data

## Final Project
The final project (module7) integrates multiple techniques learned throughout the course to solve a comprehensive unsupervised learning problem, demonstrating proficiency in:
- Data preprocessing for unsupervised learning
- Algorithm selection based on data characteristics
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal cluster formation
- Evaluation of clustering results without ground truth labels
- Visualization of high-dimensional clusters

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
